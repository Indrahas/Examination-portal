# Examination-portal
The objectives of this program are the registration for  online exam, verification of student identity, and to conduct the test.
First of all students will submit their personal details through "registration" portal.
After that the students will login through verificaion portal. It will be opened by the studentid and the password submitted by them in registration portal. Then the students are verified whether they paid the fees or not. 
After their verification was successful then they will receive a userid which is obtained by hash tagging the students id(this is not visible to others) and they are asked to set new password(different from the password submitted in registration portal).
With the help of this userid and new password they will login into exam portal through which they will take the exam. Students will get thier results immediately after completion of exam.
There is a another portal called adminportal, through which the admin can control the status of examination. It will provide the admin to start the test or end it. He can also see the marks obtained by students after completion of exam.
